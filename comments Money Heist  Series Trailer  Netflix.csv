"2 years ago","The Professor Character Analysis Gentle eyes, tailored suite, calm, closes his hands to his body to try hide his emotions.  Plays paper fold and adjust his glasses Soft beard.  Formulates plans purely based on the analysis of the situation.  He struggles to understand others feelings, however he is pro in understanding others thinking.   Classic introvert, doesn't talk much and avoid eye contact but exceptional leadership which is rare case.  Seems to have philosophy of life or morality that guides him.  In general, professor is calm, disciplined and contained personality.  Complete slave to his habits and routines. The way he eats, he sleeps and the way he trains everythung points to his adherence to His habits.  Determination and consistency are also products of his habits.  Repeating things several times to ensure perfection or arranging things in order like machine which looks like he is OCD but title of perfectionist suits him instead of OCD.  He always generates and keeps atleast one plan ( expected reaction)and follows that plan strictly.  Highly intelligent and meticulous( great attention in detail, very careful and precise) Appears to be very determined to pull off the greatest heist in history, after years of planning.  His perfectionist attitude is apparent through his careful consideration & planning for a possible scenarios that could arise.  The forward thinking helps him in his struggle for perfection, where he urges the team ""stick to the plan"" in every situation.  Appears to have exceptional knowledge in law enforcement, negotiation tactics, hostage crisis aversion.  Also demonstrates deeper understanding of human physchology.  A majority of his plans gravely depend upon the reactions he predicts from the police, the government,& the public.This allows him to play a tense game one upmanship with inspector, where he repeatedly manages to shift the status quo ( status quo= Current state of affairs) in favour","97","@neerajkv7763","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"2 years ago (edited)","Spoiler warning (this is my opinion about the last part of the series)       If we will talk about the part5 vol.2 as the ending, this is the best way to end lcdp. I mean for me, even though professor treat this as a win-win situation, our gang is still the winner. They still has the last laugh (literally) Cause the fact that the national reserve of spain is a fake gold and they manage to leave the royal mint of spain alive is amazing.  But I think (this is just my opinion) The happy ending doesn't suit the story(ep 10), since they are robbers and bad guys (But still I love them so much) and we all know what would happen to the bad guys. I dont know much about politics and law or smth, but do they really offer this? (The perfect and new life), cause if they really did....I'll better start planning a heist(jk)  So over all, this series really deserves the hype that it gets, I just have some questions, like the letter that prof. gave to rafael (probably this will be shown in berlin spin-off) and also I feel bad for the father of manila when he heard the news that they came out to the bank in a bag( but for sure manila would reach out to him)","1","@rovilcereno3828","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"5 months ago","For me this series is perfect. Well done to the crew, who is involved in the creation, to actors, who played their roles perfectly. Without realising, you end up binging half a season in one night. This is the series my husband and I watched from beginning to end in no time. It keeps the tension all the time, you become empathetic with the characters and even end up loving the bad guys. I don't have words, just watch and enjoy! This is one of the best series of all time!","1","@user-sj7ut2rg9c","false","false","false","false","","false",""

When i gaze at this video, it gazes back at me and fills me with the confidence i need to take on my sexual desires in the workplace (toward my squidward bodypillow.) The title itself macabre touch on the postmodern world that we as a species inhabit. The narrative of this video reminds me of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which depicted a world where books are burnt by the government, something completely unrelated to this video at a glace.

The ending was beautiful, the characters we have lost on the way was not waisted, I really thought it was the end that’s when the police started coming in and the professor giving himself up I’m like noooo that’s it like really but his mind what a great mind, I mean great character man he’s really good.

TV shows and doctors are paid for vaccine advertising so fake news are spread. Huge propaganda is going on for to use out vaccine doses that were made for the first type covid-19. Ex. the government of Lithuania bought 5-6 of these vaccines for each citizen. Virus mutated and now these vaccines provide little or non protection. Thousands of these vaccines have been discarded because expired date. Stupid thing is that health minister of Lithuania doesnt have any medical education. He is a klerk and blindly follows his party leaders orders. As  the prime minister of Lithuania said ""All (those who didn't have vaccine) will be vaccinated (not for health) but for those who were vaccinated not to feel fools"".

"1 year ago","A review: 5 Seasons but only two stories. Both heists are genius and unique. First heist is the best. Second heist was way to long and the realism/believability went downhill very quickly. In the first heist, it was obvious that they wanted to promote a political ideology but it went to crazy levels in the second one, going as far as shaming someone for calling the new baby a girl. It was kind of disgusting in my opinion and a huge distraction for someone that doesn't fall for all this ""I say I'm a girl and therefore I am one."" crap. It was over the top.  All the actors are great. The only character I wasn't a fan of was the police boss in the second heist. It was either a case in over acting or poor writing for him. They turned him into a borderline out of control jerk instead of making him a methodical savvy, save his own butt, type of guy.","0","@blusheep2","false","false","false","false","","false",""

But during the 4th season all of the sudden the writing got worse and the show became wokified. They added a trans character that stuck out like a sore thumb. They were a terrible addition to the gang. They had no purpose other than being the trans character. The writing took a hit as well. The brilliance of the first 2 seasons disappeared. It's as if someone took over the show and told the writers that they have to make the story more woke and also add a trans character to check some kind of diversity box. It was really disappointing to watch. Took a lot of the joy out of the experience.  I noticed that Netflix took over this show in the later seasons, so that might be the reason for it's drop in quality. Having said all that, it still had a satisfying ending and was one of the best shows I've seen.","0","@Inquiringmind0","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","​ @siddharthbharadwaj4449 First off, this is not even a ""movie."" This is a TV series, two completely different things. Second off, this was not even created at first by Netflix but originally intended to be a limited 15-episode series told in two parts. It was only run on a Spanish network channel (in Spain) called Antena 3.  Netflix acquired the rights to stream it globally and re-cut the series into 22 episodes worldwide. They then increased the budget drastically after renewing series 3, then 4, and finally ended it with season 5.  This show was a MASSIVE HIT, many shows end up being called and that itself is a success to finish. This show became so popular it was even English Dubbed with the entire cast. Not only this but South Korea even made their own related version of the series on Netflix that is currently in its second season, it is called ""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area.""  There is also a spin off coming up from the ""Money Heist"" that is set featuring the main character as ""Berlin"" one who took place and played a large role in the series. So his own Spanish drama that has to do with his past as a robber will also be on Netflix world wide. Again this TV show ws not started by Netflix, its actual name ""La Casa de Papal"" means ""The House of Paper,"" however in English Netflix changed it to the title of ""Money Heist"" that they thought more appealing to others.  This series was so popular around the world globally that it was nominated 62 times! It was awarded 29 awards! By 2018 (after it was aired abd before English dub) it was the most watched non English language and overall most watched series period.  You are literally the very first person who has series thought of this show causing or promoting crime or terrorism. Have you actually watched this series to truly understand the true story? You obviously have not or just have no idea of what the plot is about. This is also a total fictional series, how many people do you think they really think ""Oh gosh now I want to rob a bank!"" Give me a break! The only fool who thinks that is you.  Do you think Netflix will care whatsoever 🤔 at all for you simple opinion vs the drastic support on the massive fan and amazing lovers over this show.  There have been other TV shows, movies, video games (for kids) that give very similar vibes to what it seems you would act toward.
